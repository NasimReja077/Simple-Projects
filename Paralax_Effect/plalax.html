               Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, 
               such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from that which does not, 
               and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, 
               energy transformation, and reproduction.Various forms of life exist,such as
               plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. Biology is 
               the science that studies life.

               The Earth has been nourishing and protecting us every moment by giving 
               us air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat. It has offered home 
               to humans and several billions of living species that directly or 
               indirectly benefits the humans, for millions of years. Earth once 
               green, pure and rich in natural resources has been exploited again 
               and again by man for his greed. <br> 
               Natural resources found on the earth are deteriorating day by day, endangering 
               life on earth. Many wild animals have become completely extinct due to lack of 
               favorable environments. Different types of pollution, global warming and other 
               environmental issues are increasing day by day. Many people around the globe are 
               raising their voices against climatic change. If this scenario continues, the 
               necessities of todayâ€™s world will become a luxury for our future generations and 
               humankind will meet its doomsday very soon.

               Marine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals and other organisms that 
               live in the salt water of seas or oceans, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. 
               At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms,
               mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Marine life in part shape 
               and protect shorelines, and some marine organisms even help create new land 
               (e.g. coral building reefs). <br>
               invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated 
               waters, including breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons. Fish have gills instead of 
               lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals 
               ( e.g. dolphins, whales, otters, and seals) need to surface periodically to breathe 
               air.

          <p class="pr2">
               Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all 
               organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.
               Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for 
               sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands,
               forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct 
               forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that 
               are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected 
               by human activities.[2] Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and 
               quality of life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to 
               human beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.

               Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, 
               characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the 
               development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social 
               and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and 
               competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social 
               interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, 
               and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand 
               and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated 
               humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields 
               of study.
